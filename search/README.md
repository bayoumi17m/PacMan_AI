The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration).
**Depth First Search**
Algorithm to traverse or searching the graph structure (of states). Starts at the root node and explores along one brach before backtracking. I used a stack for the data structure to hold the nodes to explore

**Breadth First Search**
Algorithm to traverse or searching the graph structure (of states). Starts at root node, and explores all of the neighbor nodes prior to moving on to the next depth level. I used a queue for the data structure to hold the nodes to explore

**Uniform Cost Search**
Uniform Cost Search is the best algorithm for a search problem, which does not involve the use of heuristics. It can solve any general graph for optimal cost. Uniform Cost Search as it sounds searches in branches which are more or less the same in cost. I used a priority queue for the data structure to hold the nodes to explore

**A\* Search**
A computer algorithm used in path finding. It is an informed search, in that it considers the ones that appear to lead quickly to the solution. I used a priotity queue for the data structure to hold the nodes to explore
